# MAUI-SpaceTrader

MAUI-SpaceTrader is a .NET MAUI Blazor implementation of the SpaceTraders API, designed to provide a learning platform for consuming REST APIs. The project utilizes RestSharp for handling API requests, SQL-net for local data storage, and Serilog for logging.

## Project Status

At this stage, the project is currently in development, with basic functionality being implemented and rudimentary UI for different API endpoints being created. The aim is to implement sufficient functionality before refining the user experience using the default .NET MAUI tools.

As the project progresses, additional features will be added, and enhancements to the UI will be made. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the functionality and usability of the application.

## Getting Started

To use SpaceTrader, simply clone the repository and run the project in Visual Studio. Once the project is running, you can begin to interact with the different endpoints of the SpaceTraders API. 

## Dependencies

SpaceTrader relies on several dependencies, including RestSharp for handling REST API requests, SQL-net for local data storage, and Serilog for logging. Be sure to have these dependencies installed before running the project.
